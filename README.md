1. The key differences between unary, server streaming, and bi-directional streaming RPC methods are:

- Unary: Client sends a single request and receives a single response. Best for simple request-response interactions like fetching a single resource.
- Server streaming: Client sends a single request and receives a stream of responses. Useful for retrieving large datasets or real-time updates from the server.
- Bi-directional streaming: Both client and server can send streams of messages independently. Ideal for real-time communication and chat-like applications.

2. Key security considerations for gRPC in Rust include using secure authentication mechanisms like token-based auth or mTLS, enforcing proper authorization checks on the server side, and encrypting data both in transit (via TLS) and at rest. Carefully validate and sanitize all inputs. Use secure coding practices to avoid vulnerabilities.

3. Challenges with bi-directional streaming in Rust gRPC for chat apps include handling concurrent connections efficiently, gracefully dealing with disconnects, implementing rate limiting and anti-abuse measures, ensuring proper error handling and back-pressure, and scaling the system while maintaining real-time performance. Proper testing is crucial.

4. Advantages of tokio_stream::wrappers::ReceiverStream include easy integration with tokio ecosystem and ability to convert any tokio channel to a stream. Disadvantages are the additional complexity and mental overhead of stream semantics vs straight channels.

5. To promote maintainability and reusability, organize Rust gRPC code into separate logical concerns - proto definitions, server impl, client impl. Use traits to define service interfaces. Leverage Rust's module system. Keep protos focused. Refactor common logic into helper functions. Strive for loose coupling.

6. For more complex payment logic, MyPaymentService may need to integrate with external payment processors, validate business rules, handle retries and idempotency, process refunds/chargebacks, comply with PCI regs, etc. Careful error handling is key, as is logging and monitoring.

7. gRPC promotes a more tightly coupled, high performance architecture vs REST. Interop requires gRPC support in other systems or proxies. Shifts design to more fixed interfaces with structured protos vs free-form REST resources. Can enable powerful real-time capabilities.

8. HTTP/2 advantages over HTTP/1.1 for gRPC include multiplexed streams, header compression, binary protocol, server push. Enables high concurrency and performance. But requires HTTP/2 support and lack of widespread web browser support. WebSocket enables bi-directional streams but not multiplexing.

9. REST is inherently request-response, requiring polling or hacks like long-polling for real-time. gRPC bidirectional streams enable true real-time communication more efficiently without hacks. Better for low-latency, high throughput scenarios needing server-initiated messages.

10. gRPC protos define strict schemas and typed messages, enabling automatic code gen, strong typing, and tight coupling. Makes evolving APIs harder and more formal. REST+JSON is more flexible and evolvable but lacks automatic strong typing. Protos optimize performance but reduce flexibility.
